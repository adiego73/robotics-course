# Robotics course 2019
## Abstract
The course project is divided in two parts.

### First part
 * Compute two different odometries and publish both as tf and odom topic
   * Differential Drive Kinematics
   * Ackerman model
 * Use dynamic reconfigure to switch between different published odometry
 * Use dynamic reconfigure to reset the odometry to (0,0) or to set to a specific starting point (x,y)
 * Publish a custom message with odometry value and type of source

### Second part
Compute accurate and high frequency GPS position fusing:
 * Odometry (from wheels encoders and steering angle)
 * IMU (Piksi Multi board)
 * GPS (Piksi Multi board)

### Professors & Tutors
 * Matteo Matteucci, DEIB department, Politecnico di Milano
 * Simone Mentasti, DEIB department, Politecnico di Milano
